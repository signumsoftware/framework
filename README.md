[Signum Framework](http://www.signumframework.com/)
===================================================

Signum Framework is the new Open Source framework from Signum Software for writing data-centric applications over the latest Microsoft technologies: .Net 4.0, C# 4.0, WPF, ASP.Net MVC 3.0 (Razor). 

It provides a consistent model for N-layer architectures by moving the entities to the very center of your solution using Signum.Entities. 

Our cutting-edge ORM, Signum.Engine, has one of the first full LINQ Providers implemented outside Microsoft offices.

Signum.Windows dramatically simplifies giving a WPF user interface to your entities. Also Signum.Web does the same using ASP.Net MVC 3.0 / Razor / jQuery / jQuery UI
