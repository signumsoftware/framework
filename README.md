Signum Framework is an Open Source framework from Signum Software for writing data-centric applications over the latest technologies from Microsoft (.Net 4.5.1, C# 6.0, WPF, ASP.Net Web.API and Typescript) and web standard libraries (React, Bootstrap and D3) . 

The main focus of the framework is being able to write vertical modules (database tables, entities, logic and Win / Web user interface) that can be shared between projects.

It provides a consistent model for N-layer architectures by moving the entities to the very center of your solution using Signum.Entities.

Our cutting-edge ORM, Signum.Engine, has a full LINQ Providers that avoids N + 1 problem and lets you UPDATE / DELETE / INSERT entities without having to retrieve them first.

Signum.Windows dramatically simplifies writing a WPF user interface for your entities. 

Also Signum.React let's you write a Single-Page-Application using React / Bootstrap and TypeScript.
 

### Main Features ###
* Designed for vertical modules (aka: Bounded Context)
* Entities-first approach
* ORM with a full LINQ Provider
* Unified validation
* Schema generation and synchronization
* WPF smart-client interface
* React/Typescript SPA


### Principles ###
* Promote simple and clean code, avoiding astronautical architectures.
* Favor compile-time checked code over dynamic code.
* Create a solid foundation for the integration of application modules (on schema, BL and UI code).
* Encourage a more functional way of programming.
* Avoid code duplication.
* Be a good citizen wherever we are (.Net, LINQ, WPF, React) following common practices and conventions.
