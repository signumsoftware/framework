  <!-- TO EDIT BUILD TYPE DEFINITION

  To edit the build type, you will need to edit this file which was generated
  by the Create New Build Type wizard.  This file is under source control and
  needs to be checked out before making any changes.

  The file is available at -
      $/{TeamProjectName}/TeamBuildTypes/{BuildTypeName}
  where you will need to replace TeamProjectName and BuildTypeName with your
  Team Project and Build Type name that you created

  Checkout the file
    1. Open Source Control Explorer by selecting View -> Other Windows -> Source Control Explorer
    2. Ensure that your current workspace has a mapping for the $/{TeamProjectName}/TeamBuildTypes folder and 
       that you have done a "Get Latest Version" on that folder
    3. Browse through the folders to {TeamProjectName}->TeamBuildTypes->{BuildTypeName} folder
    4. From the list of files available in this folder, right click on TfsBuild.Proj. Select 'Check Out For Edit...'


  Make the required changes to the file and save

  Checkin the file
    1. Right click on the TfsBuild.Proj file selected in Step 3 above and select 'Checkin Pending Changes'
    2. Use the pending checkin dialog to save your changes to the source control

  Once the file is checked in with the modifications, all future builds using
  this build type will use the modified settings
